Reinforcement Learning Projects Repository
Welcome to my Reinforcement Learning (RL) repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the fascinating world of reinforcement learning, from simple algorithms to advanced deep reinforcement learning techniques.

Overview
Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. This repository contains a range of projects that demonstrate both basic and complex RL strategies:

Simple RL Projects: Quick and straightforward tasks where agents learn from immediate feedback to navigate mazes or play basic games like tic-tac-toe using algorithms like Q-learning and Monte Carlo methods.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Projects: More complex scenarios that integrate deep learning with reinforcement learning. Here, deep neural networks help tackle high-dimensional data for sophisticated tasks such as video games, autonomous driving, or robotic control.

Goal
The goal of this repository is to provide a practical, hands-on approach to understanding and implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms. Each project is designed to highlight different aspects of RL and DRL, providing insights into how agents learn and adapt through trial-and-error interactions.

Stay tuned for updates and new project additions that dive deeper into the versatile applications of reinforcement learning!
